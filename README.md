# Momo Themes

These themes are the ones I've modified throughout the past few years when using Sublime Text. They're a combination of Material theme, Boxy theme, Solarized theme, and some of my preferences.
With the lack of light themes, I would say mine is pretty decent and very easy on the eyes.

There're 4 themes in this package:
- based on Material themes
    - Momo Light
    - Momo Dark
- based on Solarized and Boxy
    - Momo Sol Light
    - Momo Sol Dark

Screenshots coming soon/or maybe never?

**Enjoy!**
